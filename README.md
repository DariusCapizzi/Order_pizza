# Order - Pizza

#### Object Oriented review (week 4)

#### By Darius Capizzi

## Description

Is a total mess. Makes a cookie for saved pizzas, and (only) if you reload the page, you can click on those saved pizzas. the Pizza will spring to life, looking just like the pizza you saved. Some of the more messy style decisions are commented out.


## Setup

* Download files (or go to gh pages)
* if you downloaded the file open index.html with a browser (you could also uncomment the script at the top of the js)
* enter a topping, press the "add topping" button with your mouse (do not press enter)
* change the size of the pizza with the scroll
* click the button "How much?"
* click "save pizza"
* reload the page (you'll need to enable local cookies if you downloaded this)
* click on the Pizza you saved
* please enjoy

## Known Bugs

* if you press enter while inputing a topping, it doesn't add the topping. (enter focus)

* no clearing of cookies

* need to add pizza image to new pizzas

* only one image seems to jump around at a time.
